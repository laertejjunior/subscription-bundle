What is a product strategy
==========================

When you create a new subscription, you set up a product with it. But what happens when a subscription is renewed? We 
should continue using the same product? This is why exists the product strategy: to determine what product should be
used in this kind of actions. For example: you can create a promotional product and when the subscription expires renew
it with the non-promotional product.
